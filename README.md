Lumiclean is a **genetically modified microorganism (GMO)** developed to **detect** and **degrade pollutants** in water.  
It glows when in contact with pollutants (via the *lux operon*) and breaks them down into harmless byproducts.

This repository also powers the **Lumiclean Community Platform** — connecting citizens, researchers, and biotech organizations to report polluted areas, request deployments, and collaborate on cleanups.
